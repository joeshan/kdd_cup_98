                            1st 2 bytes of the code refers to the year of the 
                            mailing while 3rd and 4th bytes refer to the 
                            following promotion codes/types: 

                            LL mailings had labels only

                               not have labels

                            This information could certainly be used to calculate 
                            several summary variables that count the number of 
                            occurrences of various types of promotions received 
                            in the most recent 12-36 months, etc. 

                            RFA (RECENCY/FREQUENCY/AMOUNT)
                            ------------------------------
 
                            The RFA (recency/frequency/amount) status of the 
                            donors (as of the promotion dates) is included in the 
                            RFA fields.
 
                            The (current) concatenated version is a nominal 
                            or symbolic field. The individual bytes could 
                            separately be used as fields and refer to the 
                            following: 

                            First Byte of code is concerned with RECENCY
                            based on Date of the last Gift

                            F=FIRST TIME DONOR Anyone who has made their
                              first donation in the last 6 months and has
                              made just one donation.

                            N=NEW DONOR Anyone who has made their first
                              donation in the last 12 months and is not a
                              First time donor.  This is everyone who made
                              their first donation 7-12 months ago, or
                              people who made their first donation between
                              0-6 months ago and have made 2 or more
                              donations.

                            A=ACTIVE DONOR Anyone who made their first
                              donation more than 12 months ago and has made
                              a donation in the last 12 months.

                            L=LAPSING DONOR A previous donor who made their
                              last donation between 13-24 months ago.

                            I=INACTIVE DONOR A previous donor who has not
                              made a donation in the last 24 months.  It is
                              people who made a donation 25+ months ago.

                            S=STAR DONOR STAR Donors are individuals who
                              have given to 3 consecutive card mailings.


                            Second Byte of code is concerned with FREQUENCY
                            based on the period of recency.  The period of
                            recency for all groups except L and I is the
                            last 12 months.  For L it is 13-24 months ago,
                            and for I it is 25-36 months ago.  There are
                            four valid frequency codes.

                            1=One gift in the period of recency 
                            2=Two gift in the period of recency 
                            3=Three gifts in the period of recency 
                            4=Four or more gifts in the period of recency

                            Third byte of the code is the Amount of the last
                            gift.
